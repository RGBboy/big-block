# Big Block

An javascript game engine designed to work in a browser and on a node.js 
server.

Big Block is still very early in development. Expect API changes as we make it 
more simple, flexible and testable.

# Goals

## Simple

Big Block is simple. It does not impose how the game loop must work nor any 
other core functionality you get from other game engines.

## Flexible

Big Block has been made so you can compose your game with the Entities, Components and 
Systems that you need. There are already [a few on NPM to choose from](https://www.npmjs.org/search?q=%22big+block%22) 
or you can simply create your own.

## Testable

I don't like manual testing. I just want to know that my game will work across 
the browsers I want to support. Big Block has been built with automated 
testing at its core. Just write your tests once and know that your game is 
stable each time it passes.

# Example



# Install

With [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:

```
npm install -g big-block
```

# Entities



# Components



# Systems



# Dependency Injection

Big Block uses `di.js` for dependency injection. `di.js` relieves developers 
of having to maintain a main method to instantiate and pass around the systems 
(aka singletons). When you create a new game with Big Block you pass in an 
array of systems that have been registered with `di.js`. When one of these 
systems is requested, `di.js` instantiates and injects all dependencies into 
the system. The dependencies that are injected are singletons and are only 
instantiated once in the lifetime of a game.

# API

`var BigBlock = require('big-block');`

## BigBlock.EntitySystem

## var game = BigBlock([systems])

## game.get(token)

Get the instantiated system associated with `token`.
